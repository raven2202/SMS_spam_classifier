# SMS_spam_classifier
This project is a machine learning-based SMS spam classifier that distinguishes between legitimate ("ham") and unsolicited ("spam") messages. It involves a complete pipeline from data cleaning and exploratory data analysis to text preprocessing, model building, evaluation, and improvement, with future plans for a web interface and deployment.
